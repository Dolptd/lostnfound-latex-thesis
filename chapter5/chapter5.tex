\chapter{Summary and Suggestions}

\section{Introduction}
This chapter summarizes the project's outcomes, identifies the obstacles faced during development, and proposes strategies to address them. Additionally, it provides recommendations for improving the system's functionality and scalability to influence future revisions of the LostNFound platform.

\section{Project Summary}
The LostNFound platform introduced a centralized lost-and-found management system for King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT). The system streamlines reporting and recovering lost items, integrating a Next.js full-stack framework for user interaction and a FastAPI-powered backend. Advanced features such as Natural Entity Recognition (NER) and text similarity algorithms are employed for accurate item matching. PostgreSQL is used for reliable data management, and Docker with Google Cloud Run ensures seamless deployment and scalability. By addressing the inefficiencies of existing manual processes, this digital solution reduces response time and enhances user experience.

\section{Problems Encountered and Solutions}
\subsection{Matching Algorithm Development}
A significant challenge was finding an appropriate matching algorithm to achieve accurate and efficient recommendations. Extensive research and testing were conducted throughout development to fine-tune the algorithm, which ultimately met the projectâ€™s requirements.

\subsection{Domain Mapping to Server}
Initially, mapping the domain name to the server posed difficulties due to inexperience with Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This issue was resolved by consulting documentation, properly configuring DNS settings, and successfully linking the domain to the server.

\section{Suggestions for Further Development}
\subsection{Mobile Application}
Developing a mobile version of the platform will increase accessibility and usability for KMUTT students.

\subsection{Scalability}
Expanding the system to support other universities or institutions facing similar lost-and-found challenges will broaden its impact.

\subsection{AI Enhancement}
Enhancing the item-matching algorithms with machine learning techniques can handle more complex scenarios, such as multi-language descriptions or vague item details.
