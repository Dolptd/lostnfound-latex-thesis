LostNFound KMUTT is a web-based platform designed to assist KMUTT students and university personnel in efficiently managing lost and found items within the university. The platform allows users to report lost or found items through dedicated forms, providing item descriptions, locations, and timestamps for precise matching. It utilizes advanced technologies such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text similarity matching and secure authentication via university email to ensure rightful ownership. Additionally, it features a history of claimed items for accountability and a notification system to remind users to retrieve their belongings promptly.

The development process demonstrates the feasibility of creating an efficient lost-and-found management system using existing university resources and modern web technologies. By streamlining the process, the platform minimizes user frustration and enhances operational productivity for KMUTT staff.
